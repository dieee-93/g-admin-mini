### Architecture Pattern: Screaming Architecture

The project follows a "Screaming Architecture" pattern, where the directory structure and organization immediately communicate the system's primary capabilities and domains. Each feature module is self-contained with its own:
- `data/`: API and data fetching logic
- `ui/`: Presentation components
- `logic/`: Business logic and hooks
- `types.ts`: Domain-specific type definitions
- `index.tsx`: Module exports and configurations
