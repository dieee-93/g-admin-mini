# Architecture Audit - Part 3: Diagrams & Metrics

## 9. Architecture Diagrams & Metrics

### 9.1 Current vs Target Architecture Score

Current: 7.2/10  
Target: 9.5/10  
Improvement: +2.3 points (32% increase)  
Effort: 23 days (4.6 weeks)

### 9.2 Critical Issues Summary

1. Chakra Direct Imports: 80 files  
2. Alert Systems: 3 overlapping  
3. Missing Barrel Exports: 40% modules  
4. Relative Imports: 95 violations  
5. Offline Support: Only 21% adoption  

### 9.3 Refactoring Priorities

Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Critical fixes - 5 days  
Phase 2 (Week 3-4): High-priority - 5 days  
Phase 3 (Week 5-6): Structural - 6 days  
Phase 4 (Week 7-8): Optimization - 7 days  

## 10. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. Add ESLint rule: no-restricted-imports for Chakra
2. Start Chakra migration (80 files)
3. Consolidate alert systems to v2.1

### Short-term (2-4 weeks)
4. Add barrel exports to all modules
5. Fix relative imports
6. Remove deprecated security layer
7. Consolidate services

### Long-term (2 months)
8. Flatten deep nesting
9. Split large files
10. Extend offline support
11. Increase EventBus adoption

## Conclusion

Architecture is STRONG (7.2/10) but has CRITICAL issues affecting consistency and maintainability.

Investment of 23 days will yield HIGH ROI through improved developer productivity, consistency, and scalability.

Recommended approach: Execute phases sequentially over 8 weeks with weekly validation checkpoints.
