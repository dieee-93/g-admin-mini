# Security Audit Report - G-Admin Mini

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Auditor:** Claude Code (Security Analysis)
**Scope:** Full-stack security analysis (Frontend, Backend, Database, Infrastructure)

## Executive Summary

### Overall Security Posture: MODERATE (6.5/10)

G-Admin Mini demonstrates a solid foundation with modern security patterns but has critical gaps in production-ready security measures.

### Key Findings

| Category | Status | Risk Level |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Authentication & Authorization | GOOD | LOW |
| Input Validation | PARTIAL | MEDIUM |
| SQL Injection Prevention | EXCELLENT | LOW |
| API Security | NEEDS WORK | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| Client-Side Security | PARTIAL | MEDIUM |
| Data Protection | NEEDS WORK | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| Dependency Security | GOOD | LOW |

### Critical Issues (P0 - Immediate Action Required)

1. **No CSRF protection** - validateCsrfToken() is a placeholder
2. **Rate limiting client-side only** - In-memory Map vulnerable to bypass
3. **Weak password hashing** - SHA-256 instead of bcrypt/argon2
4. **No secrets encryption** - Sensitive data in localStorage unencrypted
5. **Missing Content Security Policy** - No CSP headers configured

## Analysis completed across:
- 12+ service files (database operations)
- 20+ Zod validation schemas
- Authentication & authorization system
- RLS policies on 10+ database tables
- 573 npm dependencies
- Client-side security patterns

### Final Recommendation

**DO NOT deploy to production** until P0 issues are resolved.

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 weeks for P0 fixes

See full detailed analysis in sections below.


## 9. Penetration Testing Scenarios

### 9.1 Authentication Bypass Attempt
**Verdict:** PROTECTED - ProtectedRouteNew redirects to /login

### 9.2 Privilege Escalation Attempt
**Verdict:** PROTECTED - RoleGuard blocks with error message

### 9.3 XSS Injection Attempt
**Verdict:** VULNERABLE (if sanitization not enforced)

### 9.4 SQL Injection Attempt
**Verdict:** PROTECTED - Supabase auto-escapes parameters

### 9.5 CSRF Attack Attempt
**Verdict:** CRITICAL VULNERABILITY - No CSRF validation

### 9.6 Rate Limit Bypass Attempt
**Verdict:** CRITICAL VULNERABILITY - Client-side limit easily bypassed

### 9.7 Session Hijacking Attempt
**Verdict:** MEDIUM RISK - Token in localStorage (requires XSS first)

## 10. Recommendations Priority Matrix

### P0 - CRITICAL (Fix Immediately)

| Issue | Impact | Effort | ETA |
|-------|--------|--------|-----|
| Implement CSRF protection | HIGH | MEDIUM | 1 week |
| Move rate limiting to server | HIGH | MEDIUM | 1 week |
| Replace SHA-256 with bcrypt | HIGH | LOW | 3 days |
| Add Content Security Policy | HIGH | LOW | 1 day |
| Move security logs to database | MEDIUM | LOW | 3 days |

### P1 - HIGH (Fix within 1 month)

| Issue | Impact | Effort | ETA |
|-------|--------|--------|-----|
| Encrypt PII at rest | HIGH | HIGH | 2 weeks |
| Implement session timeout | MEDIUM | LOW | 3 days |
| Add comprehensive audit logging | HIGH | MEDIUM | 1 week |
| Enforce sanitization in all forms | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | 1 week |
| Add security headers | MEDIUM | LOW | 2 days |

### P2 - MEDIUM (Fix within 3 months)

| Issue | Impact | Effort | ETA |
|-------|--------|--------|-----|
| Implement request signing | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | 1 week |
| Add MFA/2FA support | HIGH | HIGH | 3 weeks |
| Encrypt localStorage data | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | 1 week |
