**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Auditor:** Claude Code (Security Analysis)  
**Scope:** Full-stack security analysis (Frontend, Backend, Database, Infrastructure)

## Executive Summary

### Overall Security Posture: MODERATE (6.5/10)

G-Admin Mini demonstrates a solid foundation with modern security patterns but has critical gaps in production-ready security measures. The application shows good practices in some areas (RLS policies, authentication framework) while lacking in others (rate limiting, CSRF protection, secrets management).

### Key Findings

| Category | Status | Risk Level |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Authentication & Authorization | GOOD | LOW |
| Input Validation | PARTIAL | MEDIUM |
| SQL Injection Prevention | EXCELLENT | LOW |
| API Security | NEEDS WORK | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| Client-Side Security | PARTIAL | MEDIUM |
| Data Protection | NEEDS WORK | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| Dependency Security | GOOD | LOW |

### Critical Issues (P0 - Immediate Action Required)
1. **No CSRF protection** - validateCsrfToken() is a placeholder
2. **Rate limiting client-side only** - In-memory Map vulnerable to bypass
3. **Weak password hashing** - SHA-256 instead of bcrypt/argon2
4. **No secrets encryption** - Sensitive data in localStorage unencrypted
5. **Missing Content Security Policy** - No CSP headers configured
