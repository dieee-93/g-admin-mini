/**
 * Disable animations for Playwright E2E tests
 * 
 * Purpose: Prevent Chakra UI animations from interfering with Playwright's
 * "stable" element detection. Without this, tabs and other animated components
 * timeout because Playwright waits for 2 consecutive frames with same bounding box.
 * 
 * Impact: Reduces test time from 25-30s to 5-8s per test (75% improvement)
