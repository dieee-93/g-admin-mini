## Architecture

### File Structure

\
### Key Technologies

- **Cost Intelligence**: Industry-standard yield calculations (AP/EP ratios)
- **Menu Engineering**: Four-quadrant analysis matrix
- **Real-time Pricing**: Dynamic cost updates with supplier integration
- **TypeScript**: Comprehensive type safety for complex data structures
- **React + Chakra UI**: Modern component architecture

## Usage

### Recipe Intelligence Dashboard

The main dashboard provides three views:

1. **Recipe Intelligence** - Smart cost analysis and menu engineering
2. **Quick Builder** - AI-powered recipe creation  
3. **Classic View** - Traditional recipe management (backward compatibility)

### Recipe-Inventory Integration

#### Creating Elaborated Items
1. In Inventory, select "Elaborated" item type
2. Use the recipe selector to link active recipes
3. Preview shows ingredients, yield, and preparation time
4. Auto-validation ensures recipe selection for elaborated items

#### Production Planning
1. Access the Production Schedule calendar tab
2. Click dates to view/create production plans
3. Visual indicators show production status by color
4. Capacity warnings alert when production exceeds limits

### Enhanced Testing Suite

#### Running Tests
```bash
# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Performance benchmarks  
npm run test:performance

# Component tests
npm run test:components
```
